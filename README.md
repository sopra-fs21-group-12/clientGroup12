## Introduction

### What's the aim of the application?

Swap your belongings for something better!

The goal of this project was to create a trading plattform, however with a twist. Instead of having a boring and dull looking interface, the user is animated to swipe on other items, that he is interested in. In our application the user is able to upload multiple pictures, add a description, a title and is even able to set the location for his items, that he wants to trade with. Based on tags, that he chooses the user can then filter his suggestions for trading. The swiping is ingenious, letting him do this in a Tinder like fashion. A chat let's him then do the further negotiations about the trade.

## Technologies
### Programming language and enviroment

#### React JS (Visual Studio Code)

#### Material UI for React
To style our application we choose Material UI, as it is pretty simple to use and makes the page look much nicer. The documentation can be found right here:

#### RSuite
We also used the RSuite library, besides Material UI for our styling. A documentation can be found right here:

We also used the Google Maps API in the frontend, to make sure we can get the location of the items. For further information see:
